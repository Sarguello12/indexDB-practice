        <h1>IndexedDb Notes</h1>
        <p>IndexedDB is a database that is built into a browser, much more powerful than localStorage.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stores almost any kind of values by keys, multiple key types.</li>
            <li>Supports transactions for reliability.</li>
            <li>Supports key range queries, indexes.</li>
            <li>Can store much bigger volumes of data than localStorage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That power is usually excessive for traditional client-server apps. IndexedDB is intended for offline apps, to be combined with ServiceWorkers and other technologies.

            The native interface to IndexedDB, described in the specification <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB" target="_blank">https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB</a>, is event-based.
            
            We can also use async/await with the help of a promise-based wrapper, like <a href="https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb" target="_blank">https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb</a>. 
            That’s pretty convenient, but the wrapper is not perfect, it can’t replace events for all cases. 
            So we’ll start with events, and then, after we gain an understanding of IndexedDb, we’ll use the wrapper.</p>

            <fieldset>
            <h4>Where’s the data?</h4>
            <p>Technically, the data is usually stored in the visitor’s home directory, along with browser settings, extensions, etc.
                Different browsers and OS-level users have each their own independant storage.
                </p>

            (function(){
            // checks if the browser supports indexDb
            if (!('indexedDB' in window)) {
                console.log("This browser doesn't support IndexedDB");
                return;
            }
            
            // opens database
            let openRequest = indexedDB.open("food", 1);

            // if database is able to open code will run
            openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
                console.log("sandos coming your way")
            }

            // if database is unable to open code will run
            openRequest.onerror = function(){
                console.log("Error", openRequest.error);
            }

            // if database is created it can be then updated by adding stores
            openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
                let db = openRequest.result;

                // checks if there's no "Sandos" store
                if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains("Sandos")) {
                    // creates the store with name and keyPath (a path to an object property that IndexedDB will use as the key, e.g. id)
                    db.createObjectStore("Sandos", {keyPath: "id"});
                }
